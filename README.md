## Notes

- Code compiles under JDK 1.8
- Application uses Spring Boot
- MongoDB needs to be installed locally and can be started with `./mongodb.sh`. By default, the script 
uses `$HOME/data/db` as the database directory, but can be changed as required.
- Upon each run of the tests or starting of the Spring Boot application, existing data for the application is cleared
then reloaded.
